# Hero Media Placeholders

Add your real hero video files here:

- `hero-placeholder.webm` (preferred for performance)
- `hero-placeholder.mp4` (fallback)
- keep `hero-poster.svg` as a poster fallback, or replace with your own optimized poster image

Suggested targets:

- Duration: 8-20 seconds, seamless loop
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or lower
- Size: ideally under 8MB per file
- Video should remain readable behind overlay text (avoid very bright centers)
