    <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
      I am a software engineer and event tech specialist based in Hamburg, Germany. With a passion for
      both coding and live event production, I have built a unique skill set that allows me to excel in
      both fields. I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, as
      well as extensive knowledge of lighting, laser, sound and stage production for clubs, festivals and
      corporate events.
