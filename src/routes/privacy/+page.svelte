				If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art.

				to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate
				to release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not have
				any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S.
				agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your

			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase">Data processing through social networks</h3>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual social networks
				we use can be found below.
			</p>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter etc. can generally analyze your user behavior
				comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content
				(e.g., like buttons or banner ads). When you visit our social media pages, numerous data
				protection-relevant processing operations are triggered. In detail:
			</p>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the
				operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under
				certain circumstances, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or
				do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is
				collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.
			</p>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create
				user profiles in which their preferences and interests are stored. This way you can see
				interest-based advertising inside and outside of your social media presence. If you have an
				account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device
				you are logged in to or have logged in to.
			</p>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media
				portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be
				carried out by the operators of the social media portals. Details can be found in the terms
				of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="space-y-4">
			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase">Legal basis</h3>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet.
				This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The analysis
				processes initiated by the social networks may be based on divergent legal bases to be
				specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g., consent within the meaning of Art.
				6 (1) (a) GDPR).
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="space-y-4">
			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase">Responsibility and assertion of rights</h3>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together with the operator
				of the social media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered
				during this visit. You can in principle protect your rights (information, correction,
				deletion, limitation of processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as
				vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g., Facebook).
			</p>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators,
				we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals.
				Our options are determined by the company policy of the respective provider.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="space-y-4">
			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase">Storage time</h3>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our
				systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the
				purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored cookies remain on your device until you delete
				them. Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular, retention periods - remain unaffected.
			</p>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by the social
				network operators for their own purposes. For details, please contact the social network
				operators directly (e.g., in their privacy policy, see below).
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="space-y-4">
			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase">Your rights</h3>
			<p class="leading-relaxed">
				You have the right to receive information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your
				stored personal data at any time and free of charge. You also have the right to object, the
				right to data portability and the right to file a complaint with the responsible regulatory
				agency. Furthermore, you can request the correction, blocking, deletion and, under certain
				circumstances, the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
