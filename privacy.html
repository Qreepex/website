          </p>
          <p>
            The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes
            decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail
            addresses, etc.).
          </p>

          <h3>Storage duration</h3>
          <p>
            Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will
            remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified
            request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have
            other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention
            periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
          </p>
          <h3>General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3>
          <p>
            If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or
            Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case
            of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based
            on Art. 49 (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in
            your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect; 25
            (1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a
            contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art.
            6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it
            on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our
            legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each
            individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
          </p>
          <h3>Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</h3>
          <p>
            Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or other from a data protection
            perspective non-secure non-EU countries. If these tools are active, your personal data may potentially be
            transferred to these non-EU countries and may be processed there. We must point out that in these countries,
            a data protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S.
            enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data
            subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that
            U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your personal data
            for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these processing activities.
          </p>
          <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>

            A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also
            revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness
            of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.
          </p>

            TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION.

            IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
            OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME.
            THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU
            OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION
            PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).

          <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
          <p>
            In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory
            agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
            the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any
            other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.
          </p>
          <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis of your
            consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine
            readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be
            done only if it is technically feasible.
          </p>
          <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
          <p>
            Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand
            information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the
            processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have
            questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to
            contact us at any time.
          </p>
          <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data
            is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing
            applies in the following cases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need
              some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to
              demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to
              demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
            </li>
            <li>
              If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
              entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
              of its eradication.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
              weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
              right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data &ndash; with the exception of their
            archiving &ndash; may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal
            entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public
            interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.

          <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
          <p>
            For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
            inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
            program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
            switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in
            the browser line.
          </p>
          <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small data
            packages that do not cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of
            a session (session cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session
            cookies are automatically deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your
            device until you actively delete them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, it is possible that third-party cookies are stored on your device once you enter our site
            (third-party cookies). These cookies enable you or us to take advantage of certain services offered by the
            third party (e.g., cookies for the processing of payment services).
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain website functions
            would not work in the absence of the cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos).
            The purpose of other cookies may be the analysis of user patterns or the display of promotional messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic communication transactions, or for the
            provision of certain functions you want to use (e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are
            necessary for the optimization (required cookies) of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable
            insights into the web audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless a different legal
            basis is cited. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the storage of required cookies to
            ensure the technically error free and optimized provision of the operator&rsquo;s services. If your consent
            to the storage of the cookies and similar recognition technologies has been requested, processing occurs
            exclusively on the basis of the consent obtained (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG); this consent
            may be revoked at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified any time cookies are
            placed and to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the acceptance
            of cookies in certain cases or in general or activate the delete function for the automatic eradication of

            consent.
          </p>
          <h3>Server log files</h3>
          <p>
            The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server
            log files, which your browser communicates to us automatically. The information comprises:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The type and version of browser used</li>
            <li>The used operating system</li>
            <li>Referrer URL</li>
            <li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
            <li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
            <li>The IP address</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
          <p>
            This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator of the website has a legitimate
            interest in the technically error free depiction and the optimization of the operator&rsquo;s website. In
            order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded.
          </p>
          <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
          <p>
            If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name,
            request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these
            data on without your consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of
            a contract or is required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are
            processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us
            (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been obtained; the consent
            can be revoked at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your
            consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request).
            Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.
          </p>
          <h3>Communication via WhatsApp</h3>
          <p>
            For communication with our customers and other third parties, one of the services we use is the instant
            messaging service WhatsApp. The provider is WhatsApp Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal
            Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>
            The communication is encrypted end-to-end (peer-to-peer), which prevents WhatsApp or other third parties
            from gaining access to the communication content. However, WhatsApp does gain access to metadata created
            during the communication process (for example, sender, recipient, and time). We would also like to point out
            that WhatsApp has stated that it shares personal data of its users with its U.S.-based parent company Meta.
            Further details on data processing can be found in the WhatsApp privacy policy at:
            <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of WhatsApp is based on our legitimate interest in communicating as quickly and effectively as
            possible with customers, interested parties and other business and contractual partners (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
            If a corresponding consent has been requested, data processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of
            the consent; this consent may be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The communication content exchanged between and on WhatsApp remains with us until you request us to delete
            it, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for which the data is stored ceases to apply (e.g. after
            your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions, in particular retention periods, remain
            unaffected.
          </p>
          <p>We use WhatsApp in the &ldquo;WhatsApp Business&rdquo; variant.</p>
          <p>
            Data transmission to the US is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) of the European Commission.
            Details can be found here:
            <a

              >https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-data-transfer-addendum?lang=en</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have set up our WhatsApp accounts in such a way that there is no automatic synchronization of data with
            the address book on the smartphones in use.
          </p>

          <h4>Data processing through social networks</h4>
          <p>
            We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual social networks we use can be
            found below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter etc. can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively if
            you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g., like buttons or banner
            ads). When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are
            triggered. In detail:
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the
            social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal
            data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social
            media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by
            recording your IP address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in
            which their preferences and interests are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and
            outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the social network, interest-based
            advertising can be displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on
            the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social
            media portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media
            portals.
          </p>
          <h4>Legal basis</h4>
          <p>
            Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a
            legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the
            social networks may be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the social
            networks (e.g., consent within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).
          </p>
          <h4>Responsibility and assertion of rights</h4>
          <p>
            If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together with the operator of the social
            media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in
            principle protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of processing, data portability
            and complaint) vis-&agrave;-vis us as well as vis-&agrave;-vis the operator of the respective social media
            portal (e.g., Facebook).
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have
            full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by
            the company policy of the respective provider.
          </p>
          <h4>Storage time</h4>
          <p>
            The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon
            as you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage
            lapses. Stored cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory provisions - in
            particular, retention periods - remain unaffected.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by the social network operators
            for their own purposes. For details, please contact the social network operators directly (e.g., in their
            privacy policy, see below).
          </p>
          <h4>Your rights</h4>
          <p>
            You have the right to receive information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal
            data at any time and free of charge. You also have the right to object, the right to data portability and
            the right to file a complaint with the responsible regulatory agency. Furthermore, you can request the
            correction, blocking, deletion and, under certain circumstances, the restriction of the processing of your
            personal data.
          </p>
          <h4>Individual social networks</h4>
          <h5>Twitter</h5>
